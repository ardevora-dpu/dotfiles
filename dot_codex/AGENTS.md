# Timon User Context

This user-level file is intentionally neutral for Quinlan project behaviour.

Project context should come from repository files only:
- `CLAUDE.md` (global shared context)
- `workspaces/timon/CLAUDE.md` (Timon-specific context)

Start Codex sessions from `workspaces/timon` when working on Quinlan.

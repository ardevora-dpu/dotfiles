# Ardevora Email Style

For writing principles (calibration, fluff removal, British spelling), see the `ardevora-style-editor` skill.

## Typography

- Font: Calibri 12pt
- No bold, no headers (structure comes from paragraph logic)
- Italics: one or two per email for emphasis, no more
- Em-dashes: never (use commas, brackets, or full stops instead)

## Voice

Analytical observer. "The data suggests" not "We found". Detached, evidence-forward.

## Warmth

Cold/efficient. "Hi all," for multiple internal recipients, otherwise just the person's name. Sign-off just "Timon". No "Hope you're well".

## Structure

- First sentence: the takeaway (not "I wanted to update you on...")
- Close: statement of intent in prose (not labelled "Next steps:")

## Email Length

| Type | Paragraphs | Use Case |
|------|------------|----------|
| Short | 1-2 | Pipeline fix, quick confirmation |
| Medium | 4-5 | Research findings, audit results |
| Long | 5-7 | Monthly summary, multi-topic update |

## Bullets and Brackets

Use bullets where appropriate. Use brackets to make a nested point or add context (like this!).

## Failure Modes (Outlook-specific)

- Tables for structure (tables are for data comparison only)
- Georgia or serif fonts (looks odd in Outlook dark mode)
- Excessive white space (one blank line between paragraphs is enough)
